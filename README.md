An implementation of a skill taxonomy making and development tracking app. 

Most of the functionality done through hacking  Django Admin of which 
I am very fond of. 

App is currently in beta and in Russian only. 
This implementation is considered **MVP**, meaning, 
it gets the work done, but there is A LOT left to 
do. 


Installation is the same as any other Django app.

## Features

* Interactive chart map for quick development assesment with narrowing
  * by skill
  * by observation level
  * by drilldown level
* User friendly interface for making skill development taxonomies
* Sheets/tracking/user management groups and stuff
* Nice UI
